# server-scripts

Useful scripts installed on workstations/compute servers where we have multiple
versions of certain software. Kind of mini alternative to using a full lmod system

 - `uon-activatefsl [<version>]` can be sourced to set up FSL 
 - `uon-activatecuda [<version>]` can be sourced to set up variables for CUDA compilation
 - `uon-activaterdrives <dir>` must be executed not sourced and mounts all user's R drives in the directory specified
